# IMDBepisodes
This is my big data project, which started with me scraping 60,000 records. 30,000 of episode data, and another 30,000 containing the reviews of those episodes.

After scraping all this data, I merged the csv file to a file with around 32,000 records, containing all the episode data as well as the reviews.
